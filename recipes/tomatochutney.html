    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 grams ripe tomatoes (2 to 3 tomatoes, ½ pound, refer notes)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 small garlic (5 grams)</li>
        <li>⅓ inch ginger (3 grams peeled ginger, optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 dried red chilies (5 grams, or ½ to ¾ teaspoon red chilli powder)</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 to 1¼ tablespoons oil (divided ½ + ½ to ¾ to temper)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To Temper</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>1 sprig curry leaves</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 dried red chilli broken</li>
        <li>1 to 2 small garlic cloves (crushed)</li>
        <li>⅛ to ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder (optional, adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 pinch hing (asafetida, optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the tomatoes well under running water and slice them.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and add cumin seeds. When the seeds splutter, add dried red chilies and fry them on a medium heat until crisp.</li>
            <li>Stir in the ginger (optional) and garlic. Fry them until they turn aromatic for about 1 minutes or a little longer. Don’t burn the ginger and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced tomatoes, salt and turmeric. On a medium high heat cook until the tomatoes turn completely mushy. Keep stirring in between to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove when most of the juices have evaporated and the tomatoes develop a nice flavour.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>How to Make Tomato Chutney</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cool this completely and add to a grinder and blend to a smooth puree. Taste test and adjust salt as required.</li>
            <li>Wipe down the same pan with some kitchen tissues. Pour oil to the pan and heat it.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and add the mustard seeds, red chilies and garlic. Let the garlic turn fragrant and red chilies crisp. Then add the curry leaves and fry until crisp.</li>
            <li>Stir in the red chilli powder (optional, to make it more spicy) and quickly add the pureed tomato mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix well and saute for 1 to 2 mins. If you prefer to store this tomato chutney for longer, about 3 weeks, saute for another 2 to 3 mins until it turns really hot.</li>
            <li>Serve with breakfasts, snacks or even with plain rice. To preserve this for 3 to 4 weeks, cool it completely and transfer to clean dry glass jar. Refrigerate and scoop out only with dry spoons.</li>
        </ol>
