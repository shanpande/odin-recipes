        </ul>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for at least 20 to 30 mins. Drain water and set the rice aside in a colander.</li>
        <li>Boil eggs and remove the shells and rinse them. Make few gashes using a knife or a fork. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>How to make egg biryani (stovetop)</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat a pressure cooker or a pot with oil.</li>
        <li>Add star anise, bay leaf, shahi jeera, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon and mace. Allow them to sizzle.</li>
        <li>Next add onions and green chilies. Fry/saute till golden or light brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger garlic paste. Fry till the raw smell goes off.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, mint, red chili powder, turmeric, salt and yogurt. Cook until the tomatoes turn mushy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, potatoes (if using) and biryani masala powder. Fry till the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Pour water and add salt as needed. Taste to check for salt and spice levels.</li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil & add drained rice.</li>
        <li>If cooking in pot lower the flame completely, cover and cook till the rice is done fully. If the rice seems to be uncooked, then pour few tablespoons of hot water. If using pressure cooker, close the lid and cook for 1 whistle. Set this aside, don’t leave on the hot burner.</li>
        <li>Fluff up the egg biryani and serve with raita.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Instant pot egg biryani</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Press SAUTE button on the Instant pot. Pour ghee to the inner pot of the IP.</li>
        <li>When the ghee melts add the onions. Spread them in the oil & saute occasionally until deep golden.</li>
        <li>Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnish.</li>
        <li>Add the whole spices to the pot and stir.</li>
        <li>Next add ginger garlic & chilli. Saute for 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
        <li>Then add tomatoes and sprinkle salt. Saute until the tomatoes turn mushy.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spice powders – chilli powder, turmeric and biryani masala.</li>
        <li>Then add the yogurt and deglaze the pot by scrubbing the bottom with a spatula. This releases any bits of food stuck there and avoids burn notice.</li>
        <li>Press CANCEL button when the mixture turns thick in a minute or so.</li>
        <li>Then make incisions on the eggs and stir them with the spicy masala.</li>
        <li>Layer the rice evenly in the pot.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups water around the edges and half cup on top.</li>
        <li>Ensure the rice is under the water. (Check the video below.)</li>
        <li>Add some mint leaves and saffron soaked in 1 tbsp milk (optional). Taste the water and add more salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Secure the Instant pot with the lid & position the steam release handle to sealing.</li>
        <li>Press PRESSURE COOK button (high pressure) & set the timer to 5 mins.</li>
        <li>When the Instant pot beeps wait for 6 to 7 mins. Then release rest of the pressure manually.</li>
        <li>Do not stir the egg biryani a lot. Serve it gently with a spatula.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making Raita</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Whisk 1 cup yogurt with salt.</li>
        <li>Add 1 sliced onion, green chilli & 2 tbsps coriander leaves. Mix well and serve.</li>
        </ol>
